## Practicing Data Visualization

```{r}

install.packages("here")

library(here)

# DepData<- read.csv(here('data','DeploymentMetadata.csv'))
##this one would work for anyone bc of the here package

#ggplot is the package most people use, contained within tidyverse

install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages('readr')
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)

#Load National Park data from OHI workshop
#National Parks in California
ca <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/ca.csv") 

#Acadia National Park
acadia <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/acadia.csv")

#Southeast US National Parks
se <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/se.csv")

#2016 Visitation for all Pacific West National Parks
visit_16 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/visit_16.csv")

#All Nationally designated sites in Massachusetts
mass <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/mass.csv")

#ggplot2 is the grammar of graphics, within a data frame you pick the variables and colors/design


#make some plots, need to tell what dataframe you want to work with, geoms come to play

ggplot(ca)+ geom_point(aes(x=year, y=visitors)) 

```
