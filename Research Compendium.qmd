[Introduction\
]{.underline}**In July 2022 the San Francisco Bay experienced the largest harmful algal bloom in recorded history which contributed to death of nearly 10,000 fish in Lake Merritt. HABs have become more frequent as water temperatures increase, flows decrease and the concentration of nutrients and other land pollutants aid in the growth of algae and cyanotoxins. Many scientists have been working for years to work out a metric to detect and forecast the location of these blooms.\
\
Using previous water and soil samples collected in the South Bay by the San Francisco Estuary Institute in conjunction with US Geological Surveys my PI Dr. Anand and I are hoping to build a microbial community fingerprint using 16S/18S sequencing. After comparing our findings to the water quality data that was previously collected we hope to add further to our data library with new water and soil samples. Based on our data we hope to suggest what microbial communities and nutrient loads are mostly associated with blooms to potentially help with early detection and suggest nutrient load capacities. The project idea is still heavily in the works as we are still considering adding a Waste Treatment Facility outflow aspect due to these facilities being one of the largest nutrient inputs into our waterways in the South Bay.\
